Subject: [PATCH 13/22] Paint: Enable subpixel text positioning by default

On desktop Linux, subpixel text positioning is necessary to avoid
kerning issues, and Android is no different. Even though most phone
displays have relatively high DPIs, the lack of subpixel text
positioning is only unnoticeable on high-end devices such as the Pixel 4
XL (1440x3040 @ 6.3 in => 537 dpi).

For example, on the Pixel 5 (1080 x 2340 @ 6.0 in => 432 dpi),
horizontally-scrolling labels in QS tiles can be seen "jittering"
slightly upon close observation. This was tested with the Google Sans
font on Google's stock OS. At this lower DPI, there is still a need for
subpixel text positioning (at least in some cases).

Enable subpixel text positioning by default to fix occasional kerning
issues and jittering when text is in motion.
